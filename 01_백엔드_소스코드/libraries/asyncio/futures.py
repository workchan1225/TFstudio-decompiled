    Differences:

    - This class is not thread-safe.

    - result() and exception() do not take a timeout argument and
      raise an exception when the future isn't done yet.

    - Callbacks registered with add_done_callback() are always called
      via the event loop's call_soon().

    - This class is not compatible with the wait() and as_completed()
      methods in the concurrent.futures package.

    (In Python 3.4 or later we may be able to unify the implementations.)
