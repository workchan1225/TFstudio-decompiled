    Coroutines will be wrapped in a future and scheduled in the event

    passed in.

    All futures must share the same event loop.  If all the tasks are
    done successfully, the returned future's result is the list of
    results (in the order of the original sequence, not necessarily
    the order of results arrival).  If *return_exceptions* is True,
    exceptions in the tasks are treated the same as successful
    results, and gathered in the result list; otherwise, the first
    raised exception will be immediately propagated to the returned
    future.

    Cancellation: if the outer Future is cancelled, all children (that
    have not completed yet) are also cancelled.  If any child is
    cancelled, this is treated as if it raised CancelledError --
    the outer Future is *not* cancelled in this case.  (This is to
    prevent the cancellation of one child to cause other children to
    be cancelled.)

    If *return_exceptions* is False, cancelling gather() after it
    has been marked done won't cancel any submitted awaitables.
    For instance, gather can be marked done after propagating an
    exception to the caller, therefore, calling ``gather.cancel()``
    after catching an exception (raised by one of the awaitables) from
    gather won't cancel any other awaitables.

    The statement

    is exactly equivalent to the statement

        res = await something()

    *except* that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the
    task running in something() is not cancelled.  From the POV of
    something(), the cancellation did not happen.  But its caller is
    still cancelled, so the yield-from expression still raises
    CancelledError.  Note: If something() is cancelled by other means
    this will still cancel shield().

    If you want to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended)
    you can combine shield() with a try/except clause, as follows:

        task = asyncio.create_task(something())
        try:

    Save a reference to tasks passed to this function, to avoid
    a task disappearing mid-execution. The event loop only keeps
    weak references to tasks. A task that isn't referenced elsewhere
    may get garbage collected at any time, even before it's done.
