    Useful in cases when you want to apply timeout logic around block
    of code or in cases when asyncio.wait_for is not suitable. For example:

    >>> async with asyncio.timeout(10):  # 10 seconds timeout
    ...     await long_running_task()


    delay - value in seconds or None to disable timeout logic

    long_running_task() is interrupted by raising asyncio.CancelledError,
    the top-most affected timeout() context manager converts CancelledError
    into TimeoutError.

    Like timeout() but argument gives absolute time in the same clock system
    as loop.time().

    Please note: it is not POSIX time but a time with
    undefined starting base, e.g. the time of the system power on.

    >>> async with asyncio.timeout_at(loop.time() + 10):
    ...     await long_running_task()


    when - a deadline when timeout occurs or None to disable timeout logic

    long_running_task() is interrupted by raising asyncio.CancelledError,
    the top-most affected timeout() context manager converts CancelledError
    into TimeoutError.
