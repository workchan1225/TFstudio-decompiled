Linear algebra
--------------

Linear equations
................

Basic linear algebra is implemented; you can for example solve the linear
equation system::

      x + 2*y = -10
    3*x + 4*y =  10

using ``lu_solve``::

    >>> from mpmath import *
    >>> mp.pretty = False
    >>> A = matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> b = matrix([-10, 10])
    >>> x = lu_solve(A, b)
    >>> x
    matrix(
    [['30.0'],
     ['-20.0']])

If you don't trust the result, use ``residual`` to calculate the residual ||A*x-b||::

    >>> residual(A, x, b)
    matrix(
    [['3.46944695195361e-18'],
     ['3.46944695195361e-18']])
    >>> str(eps)
    '2.22044604925031e-16'

As you can see, the solution is quite accurate. The error is caused by the
inaccuracy of the internal floating point arithmetic. Though, it's even smaller
than the current machine epsilon, which basically means you can trust the
result.

If you need more speed, use NumPy, or ``fp.lu_solve`` for a floating-point computation.

    >>> fp.lu_solve(A, b)   # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    matrix(...)

``lu_solve`` accepts overdetermined systems. It is usually not possible to solve
such systems, so the residual is minimized instead. Internally this is done
using Cholesky decomposition to compute a least squares approximation. This means
that that ``lu_solve`` will square the errors. If you can't afford this, use
``qr_solve`` instead. It is twice as slow but more accurate, and it calculates
the residual automatically.


Matrix factorization
....................

The function ``lu`` computes an explicit LU factorization of a matrix::

    >>> P, L, U = lu(matrix([[0,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]))
    >>> print(P)
    [0.0  0.0  1.0]
    [1.0  0.0  0.0]
    [0.0  1.0  0.0]
    >>> print(L)
    [              1.0                0.0  0.0]
    [              0.0                1.0  0.0]
    [0.571428571428571  0.214285714285714  1.0]
    >>> print(U)
    [7.0  8.0                9.0]
    [0.0  2.0                3.0]
    [0.0  0.0  0.214285714285714]
    >>> print(P.T*L*U)
    [0.0  2.0  3.0]
    [4.0  5.0  6.0]
    [7.0  8.0  9.0]

Interval matrices
-----------------

Matrices may contain interval elements. This allows one to perform
basic linear algebra operations such as matrix multiplication
and equation solving with rigorous error bounds::

    >>> a = iv.matrix([['0.1','0.3','1.0'],
    ...             ['7.1','5.5','4.8'],
    ...             ['3.2','4.4','5.6']])
    >>>
    >>> b = iv.matrix(['4','0.6','0.5'])
    >>> c = iv.lu_solve(a, b)
    >>> print(c)
    [   [5.2582327113062568605927528666, 5.25823271130625686059275702219]]
