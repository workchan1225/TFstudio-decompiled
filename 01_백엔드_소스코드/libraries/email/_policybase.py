A Policy object contains a set of values and\n    functions that control how input is interpreted and how output is rendered.\n    For example, the parameter 'raise_on_defect' controls whether or not an RFC\n    violation results in an error being raised or not, while 'max_line_length'\n    controls the maximum length of output lines when a Message is serialized.\n\n    Any valid attribute may be overridden when a Policy is created by passing\n    it as a keyword argument to the constructor.  Policy objects are immutable,\n    but a new Policy object can be created with only certain values changed by\n    calling the Policy instance with keyword arguments.  Policy objects can\n    also be added, producing a new Policy object in which the non-default\n    attributes set in the right hand operand overwrite those specified in the\n    left operand.\n\n    Settable attributes:\n\n    raise_on_defect     -- If true, then defects should be raised as errors.\n                           Default: False.\n\n    linesep             -- string containing the value to use as separation\n                           between output lines.  Default '\\n'.\n\n    cte_type            -- Type of allowed content transfer encodings\n\n                           7bit  -- ASCII only\n                           8bit  -- Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit is allowed\n\n                           Default: 8bit.  Also controls the disposition of\n                           (RFC invalid) binary data in headers; see the\n                           documentation of the binary_fold method.\n\n    max_line_length     -- maximum length of lines, excluding 'linesep',\n                           during serialization.  None or 0 means no line\n                           wrapping is done.  Default is 78.\n\n    mangle_from_        -- a flag that, when True escapes From_ lines in the\n                           body of the message by putting a `>' in front of\n                           them. This is used when the message is being\n                           serialized by a generator.

        defect should be a Defect subclass, but in any case must be an
        Exception subclass.  obj is the object on which the defect should be
        registered if it is not raised.  If the raise_on_defect is True, the
        defect is raised as an error, otherwise the object and the defect are
        passed to register_defect.

        This method is intended to be called by parsers that discover defects.
        The email package parsers always call it with Defect instances.

        Called by handle_defect if raise_on_defect is False.  This method is
        part of the Policy API so that Policy subclasses can implement custom
        defect handling.  The default implementation calls the append method of
        the defects attribute of obj.  The objects used by the email package by
        default that get passed to this method will always have a defects
        attribute with an append method.

        Because the default behavior of Message's __setitem__ is to append the
        value to the list of headers, it is easy to create duplicate headers
        without realizing it.  This method allows certain headers to be limited
        in the number of instances of that header that may be added to a
        Message programmatically.  (The limit is not observed by the parser,
        which will faithfully produce as many headers as exist in the message
        being parsed.)
