    """Chinese Remainder Theorem.

    The moduli in m are assumed to be pairwise coprime.  The output
    is then an integer f, such that f = v_i mod m_i for each pair out
    of v and m. If ``symmetric`` is False a positive integer will be
    returned, else \\|f\\| will be less than or equal to the LCM of the
    moduli, and thus f may be negative.

    If the moduli are not co-prime the correct result will be returned
    if/when the test of the result is found to be incorrect. This result
    will be None if there is no solution.

    The keyword ``check`` can be set to False if it is known that the moduli
    are coprime.

    Examples
    ========

    As an example consider a set of residues ``U = [49, 76, 65]``
    and a set of moduli ``M = [99, 97, 95]``. Then we have::

       >>> from sympy.ntheory.modular import crt

       >>> crt([99, 97, 95], [49, 76, 65])
       (639985, 912285)

    This is the correct result because::

       >>> [639985 % m for m in [99, 97, 95]]
       [49, 76, 65]

    If the moduli are not co-prime, you may receive an incorrect result
    if you use ``check=False``:

       >>> crt([12, 6, 17], [3, 4, 2], check=False)
       (954, 1224)
       >>> [954 % m for m in [12, 6, 17]]
       [6, 0, 2]
       >>> crt([12, 6, 17], [3, 4, 2]) is None
       True
       >>> crt([3, 6], [2, 5])
       (5, 6)

    Note: the order of gf_crt's arguments is reversed relative to crt,
    and that solve_congruence takes residue, modulus pairs.

    Programmer's note: rather than checking that all pairs of moduli share
    no GCD (an O(n**2) test) and rather than factoring all moduli and seeing
    that there is no factor in common, a check that the result gives the
    indicated residuals is performed -- an O(n) operation.

    '''First part of Chinese Remainder Theorem, for multiple application.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.ntheory.modular import crt, crt1, crt2
    >>> m = [99, 97, 95]
    >>> v = [49, 76, 65]

    The following two codes have the same result.

    >>> mm, e, s = crt1(m)
    >>> crt2(m, v, mm, e, s)
    (639985, 912285)

    However, it is faster when we want to fix ``m`` and
    compute for multiple ``v``, i.e. the following cases:

    >>> mm, e, s = crt1(m)
    >>> vs = [[52, 21, 37], [19, 46, 76]]
    >>> for v in vs:

    return None. Otherwise return ``n`` and its modulus.

    The ``mi`` values need not be co-prime. If it is known that the moduli are
    not co-prime then the hint ``check`` can be set to False (default=True) and
    the check for a quicker solution via crt() (valid when the moduli are
    co-prime) will be skipped.

    If the hint ``symmetric`` is True (default is False), the value of ``n``
    will be within 1/2 of the modulus, possibly negative.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.ntheory.modular import solve_congruence

    What number is 2 mod 3, 3 mod 5 and 2 mod 7?

    >>> solve_congruence((2, 3), (3, 5), (2, 7))
    (23, 105)
    >>> [23 % m for m in [3, 5, 7]]
    [2, 3, 2]

    If you prefer to work with all remainder in one list and
    all moduli in another, send the arguments like this:

    >>> solve_congruence(*zip((2, 3, 2), (3, 5, 7)))
    (23, 105)

    The moduli need not be co-prime; in this case there may or
    may not be a solution:

    >>> solve_congruence((2, 3), (4, 6)) is None
    True

    >>> solve_congruence((2, 3), (5, 6))
    (5, 6)

    The symmetric flag will make the result be within 1/2 of the modulus:

    >>> solve_congruence((2, 3), (5, 6), symmetric=True)
    (-1, 6)
