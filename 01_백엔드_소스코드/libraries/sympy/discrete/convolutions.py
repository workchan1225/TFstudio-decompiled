def convolution(a, b, cycle, dps, prime, dyadic, subset = (0, None, None, None, None)):
    """
    Performs convolution by determining the type of desired
    convolution using hints.

    Exactly one of ``dps``, ``prime``, ``dyadic``, ``subset`` arguments
    should be specified explicitly for identifying the type of convolution,
    and the argument ``cycle`` can be specified optionally.

    For the default arguments, linear convolution is performed using **FFT**.

    Parameters
    ==========

    a, b : iterables
        The sequences for which convolution is performed.
    cycle : Integer
        Specifies the length for doing cyclic convolution.
    dps : Integer
        Specifies the number of decimal digits for precision for
        performing **FFT** on the sequence.
    prime : Integer
        Prime modulus of the form `(m 2^k + 1)` to be used for
        performing **NTT** on the sequence.
    dyadic : bool
        Identifies the convolution type as dyadic (*bitwise-XOR*)
        convolution, which is performed using **FWHT**.
    subset : bool
        Identifies the convolution type as subset convolution.

    Parameters
    ==========

    a, b : Sequence
        The sequences for which convolution is performed.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This function performs the convolution of ``a`` and ``b`` by packing
    each into a single integer, multiplying them together, and then
    unpacking the result from the product.  The intuition behind this is
    that if we evaluate some polynomial [1]:

    .. math ::
        1156x^6 + 3808x^5 + 8440x^4 + 14856x^3 + 16164x^2 + 14040x + 8100

    at say $x = 10^5$ we obtain $1156038080844014856161641404008100$.
    Note we can read of the coefficients for each term every five digits.
    If the $x$ we chose to evaluate at is large enough, the same will hold
    for the product.

    The idea now is since big integer multiplication in libraries such
    as GMP is highly optimised, this will be reasonably fast.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.discrete.convolutions import convolution_int

    >>> convolution_int([2, 3], [4, 5])
    [8, 22, 15]
    >>> convolution_int([1, 1, -1], [1, 1])
    [1, 2, 0, -1]
