    Explanation
    ===========

    Get the matrix representation of a system of linear equations represented
    as dicts with low-level DomainElement coefficients. This is an
    *internal* function that is used by solve_lin_sys.

    Parameters
    ==========

    eqs_coeffs: list[dict[Symbol, DomainElement]]
        The left hand sides of the equations as dicts mapping from symbols to
        coefficients where the coefficients are instances of
        DomainElement.
    eqs_rhs: list[DomainElements]
        The right hand sides of the equations as instances of
        DomainElement.
    gens: list[Symbol]
        The unknowns in the system of equations.
    domain: Domain
        The domain for coefficients of both lhs and rhs.

    Returns
    =======

    The augmented matrix representation of the system as a DomainMatrix.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols, ZZ
    >>> from sympy.polys.solvers import eqs_to_matrix
    >>> x, y = symbols('x, y')
    >>> eqs_coeff = [{x:ZZ(1), y:ZZ(1)}, {x:ZZ(1), y:ZZ(-1)}]

    Explanation
    ===========

    High-level functions like ``solve`` expect Expr as inputs but can use
    ``solve_lin_sys`` internally. This function converts equations from
    ``Expr`` to the low-level poly types used by the ``solve_lin_sys``
    function.

    Parameters
    ==========

    eqs: List of Expr
        A list of equations as Expr instances
    symbols: List of Symbol
        A list of the symbols that are the unknowns in the system of
        equations.

    Returns
    =======

    Tuple[List[PolyElement], Ring]: The equations as PolyElement instances
    and the ring of polynomials within which each equation is represented.

    Examples
    ========

    """Solve a system of linear equations from a PolynomialRing

    Explanation
    ===========

    Solves a system of linear equations given as PolyElement instances of a
    PolynomialRing. The basic arithmetic is carried out using instance of
    DomainElement which is more efficient than :class:`~sympy.core.expr.Expr`
    for the most common inputs.

    While this is a public function it is intended primarily for internal use
    so its interface is not necessarily convenient. Users are suggested to use
    the :func:`sympy.solvers.solveset.linsolve` function (which uses this
    function internally) instead.

    Parameters
    ==========

    eqs: list[PolyElement]
        The linear equations to be solved as elements of a
        PolynomialRing (assumed equal to zero).
    ring: PolynomialRing
        The polynomial ring from which eqs are drawn. The generators of this
        ring are the unknowns to be solved for and the domain of the ring is
        the domain of the coefficients of the system of equations.
    _raw: bool
        If *_raw* is False, the keys and values in the returned dictionary
        will be of type Expr (and the unit of the field will be removed from
        the keys) otherwise the low-level polys types will be returned, e.g.
        PolyElement: PythonRational.

    Returns
    =======

    ``None`` if the system has no solution.

    dict[Symbol, Expr] if _raw=False

    dict[Symbol, DomainElement] if _raw=True.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.polys.solvers import solve_lin_sys, sympy_eqs_to_ring
    >>> x, y = symbols('x, y')
    >>> eqs = [x - y, x + y - 2]
    >>> eqs_ring, ring = sympy_eqs_to_ring(eqs, [x, y])
    >>> solve_lin_sys(eqs_ring, ring)
    {y: 1, x: 1}

    Passing ``_raw=False`` returns the same result except that the keys are
    ``Expr`` rather than low-level poly types.
