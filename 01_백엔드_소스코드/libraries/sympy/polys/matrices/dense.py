'''

Module for the ddm_* routines for operating on a matrix in list of lists
matrix representation.

These routines are used internally by the DDM class which also provides a
friendlier interface for them. The idea here is to implement core matrix
routines in a way that can be applied to any simple list representation
without the need to use any particular matrix class. For example we can
compute the RREF of a matrix like:

    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices.dense import ddm_irref
    >>> M = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> pivots = ddm_irref(M)
    >>> M
    [[1.0, 0.0, -1.0], [0, 1.0, 2.0]]

These are lower-level routines that work mostly in place.The routines at this
level should not need to know what the domain of the elements is but should
ideally document what operations they will use and what functions they need to
be provided with.

The next-level up is the DDM class which uses these routines but wraps them up
with an interface that handles copying etc and keeps track of the Domain of
the elements of the matrix:

    >>> from sympy.polys.domains import QQ
    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices.ddm import DDM
    >>> M = DDM([[QQ(1), QQ(2), QQ(3)], [QQ(4), QQ(5), QQ(6)]], (2, 3), QQ)
    >>> M
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> Mrref, pivots = M.rref()
    >>> Mrref
    [[1, 0, -1], [0, 1, 2]]

    '''In-place reduced row echelon form of a matrix.

    Compute the reduced row echelon form of $a$. Modifies $a$ in place and
    returns a list of the pivot columns.

    Uses naive Gauss-Jordan elimination in the ground domain which must be a
    field.

    This routine is only really suitable for use with simple field domains like
    :ref:`GF(p)`, :ref:`QQ` and :ref:`QQ(a)` although even for :ref:`QQ` with
    larger matrices it is possibly more efficient to use fraction free
    approaches.

    This method is not suitable for use with rational function fields
    (:ref:`K(x)`) because the elements will blowup leading to costly gcd
    operations. In this case clearing denominators and using fraction free
    approaches is likely to be more efficient.

    For inexact numeric domains like :ref:`RR` and :ref:`CC` pass
    ``_partial_pivot=True`` to use partial pivoting to control rounding errors.

def ddm_irref_den(a, K):
    '''a  <--  rref(a); return (den, pivots)

    Compute the fraction-free reduced row echelon form (RREF) of $a$. Modifies
    $a$ in place and returns a tuple containing the denominator of the RREF and
    a list of the pivot columns.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The algorithm used is the fraction-free version of Gauss-Jordan elimination
    described as FFGJ in [1]_. Here it is modified to handle zero or missing
    pivots and to avoid redundant arithmetic.

    The domain $K$ must support exact division (``K.exquo``) but does not need
    to be a field. This method is suitable for most exact rings and fields like
    :ref:`ZZ`, :ref:`QQ` and :ref:`QQ(a)`. In the case of :ref:`QQ` or
    :ref:`K(x)` it might be more efficient to clear denominators and use
    :ref:`ZZ` or :ref:`K[x]` instead.

    For inexact domains like :ref:`RR` and :ref:`CC` use ``ddm_irref`` instead.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices.dense import ddm_irref_den
    >>> from sympy import ZZ, Matrix
    >>> M = [[ZZ(1), ZZ(2), ZZ(3)], [ZZ(4), ZZ(5), ZZ(6)]]
    >>> den, pivots = ddm_irref_den(M, ZZ)
    >>> M
    [[-3, 0, 3], [0, -3, -6]]
    >>> den

    >>> pivots

def ddm_idet(a, K):

    Explanation
    ===========

    Compute the determinant of $a$ using the Bareiss fraction-free algorithm.
    The matrix $a$ is modified in place. Its diagonal elements are the
    determinants of the leading principal minors. The determinant of $a$ is
    returned.

    The domain $K$ must support exact division (``K.exquo``). This method is
    suitable for most exact rings and fields like :ref:`ZZ`, :ref:`QQ` and
    :ref:`QQ(a)` but not for inexact domains like :ref:`RR` and :ref:`CC`.

    This is only suitable for domains like :ref:`GF(p)`, :ref:`QQ`, :ref:`QQ_I`
    and :ref:`QQ(a)`. With a rational function field like :ref:`K(x)` it is
    better to clear denominators and use division-free algorithms. Pivoting is
    used to avoid exact zeros but not for floating point accuracy so :ref:`RR`
