class SubCommand(Protocol):
    '''In order to support editable installations (see :pep:`660`) all
    build subcommands **SHOULD** implement this protocol. They also **MUST** inherit
    from ``setuptools.Command``.

    When creating an :pep:`editable wheel <660>`, ``setuptools`` will try to evaluate
    custom ``build`` subcommands using the following procedure:

    1. ``setuptools`` will set the ``editable_mode`` attribute to ``True``
    2. ``setuptools`` will execute the ``run()`` command.

       .. important::
          Subcommands **SHOULD** take advantage of ``editable_mode=True`` to adequate
          its behaviour or perform optimisations.

          For example, if a subcommand don\'t need to generate any extra file and
          everything it does is to copy a source file into the build directory,
          ``run()`` **SHOULD** simply "early return".

          Similarly, if the subcommand creates files that would be placed alongside
          Python files in the final distribution, during an editable install
          the command **SHOULD** generate these files "in place" (i.e. write them to
          the original source directory, instead of using the build directory).
          Note that ``get_output_mapping()`` should reflect that and include mappings
          for "in place" builds accordingly.

    3. ``setuptools`` use any knowledge it can derive from the return values of
       ``get_outputs()`` and ``get_output_mapping()`` to create an editable wheel.
       When relevant ``setuptools`` **MAY** attempt to use file links based on the value
       of ``get_output_mapping()``. Alternatively, ``setuptools`` **MAY** attempt to use
       :doc:`import hooks <python:reference/import>` to redirect any attempt to import
       to the directory with the original source code and other files built in place.

    Please note that custom sub-commands **SHOULD NOT** rely on ``run()`` being
    executed (or not) to provide correct return values for ``get_outputs()``,
    ``get_output_mapping()`` or ``get_source_files()``. The ``get_*`` methods should
    work independently of ``run()``.
