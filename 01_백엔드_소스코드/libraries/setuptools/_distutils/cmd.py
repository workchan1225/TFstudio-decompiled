    '''Abstract base class for defining command classes, the "worker bees"
    of the Distutils.  A useful analogy for command classes is to think of
    them as subroutines with local variables called "options".  The options
    are "declared" in \'initialize_options()\' and "defined" (given their
    final values, aka "finalized") in \'finalize_options()\', both of which
    must be defined by every command class.  The distinction between the
    two is necessary because option values might come from the outside
    world (command line, config file, ...), and any options dependent on
    other options must be computed *after* these outside influences have
    been processed -- hence \'finalize_options()\'.  The "body" of the
    subroutine, where it does all its work based on the values of its
    options, is the \'run()\' method, which must also be implemented by every
    command class.
