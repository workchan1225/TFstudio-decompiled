    Lazily apply an eager function.

    If the backend of the input arrays is lazy, e.g. Dask or jitted JAX, the execution
    of the function is delayed until the graph is materialized; if it's eager, the
    function is executed immediately.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The function to apply.

        It must accept one or more array API compliant arrays as positional arguments.
        If `as_numpy=True`, inputs are converted to NumPy before they are passed to
        `func`.
        It must return either a single array-like or a sequence of array-likes.

        `func` must be a pure function, i.e. without side effects, as depending on the
        backend it may be executed more than once or never.
    *args : Array | int | float | complex | bool | None
        One or more Array API compliant arrays, Python scalars, or None's.

        If `as_numpy=True`, you need to be able to apply :func:`numpy.asarray` to
        non-None args to convert them to NumPy; read notes below about specific
        backends.
    shape : tuple[int | None, ...] | Sequence[tuple[int | None, ...]], optional
        Output shape or sequence of output shapes, one for each output of `func`.
        Default: assume single output and broadcast shapes of the input arrays.
    dtype : DType | Sequence[DType], optional
        Output dtype or sequence of output dtypes, one for each output of `func`.
        dtype(s) must belong to the same array namespace as the input arrays.
        Default: infer the result type(s) from the input arrays.
    as_numpy : bool, optional
        If True, convert the input arrays to NumPy before passing them to `func`.
        This is particularly useful to make NumPy-only functions, e.g. written in Cython
       or Numba, work transparently with array API-compliant arrays.
        Default: False.
    xp : array_namespace, optional
        The standard-compatible namespace for `args`. Default: infer.
    **kwargs : Any, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass verbatim to `func`.
        They cannot contain Array objects.

    Returns
    -------
    Array | tuple[Array, ...]
        The result(s) of `func` applied to the input arrays, wrapped in the same
        array namespace as the inputs.
        If shape is omitted or a single `tuple[int | None, ...]`, return a single array.
        Otherwise, return a tuple of arrays.

    Notes
    -----
    JAX
        This allows applying eager functions to jitted JAX arrays, which are lazy.
        The function won't be applied until the JAX array is materialized.
        When running inside ``jax.jit``, `shape` must be fully known, i.e. it cannot
        contain any `None` elements.

        .. warning::

            `func` must never raise inside ``jax.jit``, as the resulting behavior is
            undefined.

        Using this with `as_numpy=False` is particularly useful to apply non-jittable
        JAX functions to arrays on GPU devices.
        If ``as_numpy=True``, the :doc:`jax:transfer_guard` may prevent arrays on a GPU
        device from being transferred back to CPU. This is treated as an implicit
        transfer.

    PyTorch, CuPy
        If ``as_numpy=True``, these backends raise by default if you attempt to convert
        arrays on a GPU device to NumPy.

    Sparse
        If ``as_numpy=True``, by default sparse prevents implicit densification through
        :func:`numpy.asarray`. `This safety mechanism can be disabled
        <https://sparse.pydata.org/en/stable/operations.html#package-configuration>`_.

    Dask
        This allows applying eager functions to Dask arrays.
        The Dask graph won't be computed until the user calls ``compute()`` or
        ``persist()`` down the line.

        The function name will be prominently visible on the user-facing Dask
        dashboard and on Prometheus metrics, so it is recommended for it to be
        meaningful.

        `lazy_apply` doesn't know if `func` reduces along any axes; also, shape
        changes are non-trivial in chunked Dask arrays. For these reasons, all inputs
        will be rechunked into a single chunk.

        .. warning::

           The whole operation needs to fit in memory all at once on a single worker.

        The outputs will also be returned as a single chunk and you should consider
        rechunking them into smaller chunks afterwards.

        If you want to distribute the calculation across multiple workers, you
        should use :func:`dask.array.map_blocks`, :func:`dask.array.map_overlap`,
        :func:`dask.array.blockwise`, or a native Dask wrapper instead of
        `lazy_apply`.

    Dask wrapping around other backends
        If ``as_numpy=False``, `func` will receive in input eager arrays of the meta
        namespace, as defined by the ``._meta`` attribute of the input Dask arrays.
        The outputs of `func` will be wrapped by the meta namespace, and then wrapped
        again by Dask.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When ``xp=jax.numpy``, the output `shape` is unknown (it contains ``None`` on
        one or more axes) and this function was called inside ``jax.jit``.
    RuntimeError
        When ``xp=sparse`` and auto-densification is disabled.
    Exception (backend-specific)
        When the backend disallows implicit device to host transfers and the input
        arrays are on a non-CPU device, e.g. on GPU.
