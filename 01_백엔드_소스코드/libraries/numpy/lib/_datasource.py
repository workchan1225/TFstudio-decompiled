"""A file interface for handling local and remote data files.

The goal of datasource is to abstract some of the file system operations
when dealing with data files so the researcher doesn't have to know all the
low-level details.  Through datasource, a researcher can obtain and use a
file with one function call, regardless of location of the file.

DataSource is meant to augment standard python libraries, not replace them.
It should work seamlessly with standard file IO operations and the os
module.

DataSource files can originate locally or remotely:

- local files : '/home/guido/src/local/data.txt'
- URLs (http, ftp, ...) : 'http://www.scipy.org/not/real/data.txt'

DataSource files can also be compressed or uncompressed.  Currently only
gzip, bz2 and xz are supported.

Example::

    >>> # Create a DataSource, use os.curdir (default) for local storage.
    >>> from numpy import DataSource
    >>> ds = DataSource()
    >>>
    >>> # Open a remote file.
    >>> # DataSource downloads the file, stores it locally in:
    >>> #     './www.google.com/index.html'
    >>> # opens the file and returns a file object.
    >>> fp = ds.open('http://www.google.com/') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # Use the file as you normally would
    >>> fp.read() # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> fp.close() # doctest: +SKIP

    Repository(baseurl, destpath='.')

    A data repository where multiple DataSource's share a base

    `Repository` extends `DataSource` by prepending a base URL (or
    directory) to all the files it handles. Use `Repository` when you will
    be working with multiple files from one base URL.  Initialize
    `Repository` with the base URL, then refer to each file by its filename
    only.

    ----------

        data files.

        Path to the directory where the source file gets downloaded to for
        use.  If `destpath` is None, a temporary directory will be created.
        The default path is the current directory.

    --------
    To analyze all files in the repository, do something like this
    (note: this is not self-contained code)::
