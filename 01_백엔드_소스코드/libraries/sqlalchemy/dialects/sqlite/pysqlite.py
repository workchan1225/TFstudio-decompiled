.. dialect:: sqlite+pysqlite
    :name: pysqlite
    :dbapi: sqlite3
    :connectstring: sqlite+pysqlite:///file_path
    :url: https://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html

    Note that ``pysqlite`` is the same driver as the ``sqlite3``
    module included with the Python distribution.

Driver
------

The ``sqlite3`` Python DBAPI is standard on all modern Python versions;
for cPython and Pypy, no additional installation is necessary.


Connect Strings
---------------

The file specification for the SQLite database is taken as the "database"
portion of the URL.  Note that the format of a SQLAlchemy url is:

.. sourcecode:: text

    driver://user:pass@host/database

This means that the actual filename to be used starts with the characters to
the **right** of the third slash.   So connecting to a relative filepath
looks like::

    # relative path
    e = create_engine("sqlite:///path/to/database.db")

An absolute path, which is denoted by starting with a slash, means you
need **four** slashes::

    # absolute path
    e = create_engine("sqlite:////path/to/database.db")

To use a Windows path, regular drive specifications and backslashes can be
used. Double backslashes are probably needed::

    # absolute path on Windows
    e = create_engine("sqlite:///C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\database.db")

To use sqlite ``:memory:`` database specify it as the filename using
``sqlite:///:memory:``. It\'s also the default if no filepath is
present, specifying only ``sqlite://`` and nothing else::

    # in-memory database (note three slashes)
    e = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")
    # also in-memory database
    e2 = create_engine("sqlite://")

.. _pysqlite_uri_connections:

URI Connections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Modern versions of SQLite support an alternative system of connecting using a
`driver level URI <https://www.sqlite.org/uri.html>`_, which has the  advantage
that additional driver-level arguments can be passed including options such as
"read only".   The Python sqlite3 driver supports this mode under modern Python
3 versions.   The SQLAlchemy pysqlite driver supports this mode of use by
specifying "uri=true" in the URL query string.  The SQLite-level "URI" is kept
as the "database" portion of the SQLAlchemy url (that is, following a slash)::

    e = create_engine("sqlite:///file:path/to/database?mode=ro&uri=true")

.. note::  The "uri=true" parameter must appear in the **query string**
   of the URL.  It will not currently work as expected if it is only
   present in the :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.connect_args`
   parameter dictionary.

The logic reconciles the simultaneous presence of SQLAlchemy\'s query string and
SQLite\'s query string by separating out the parameters that belong to the
Python sqlite3 driver vs. those that belong to the SQLite URI.  This is
achieved through the use of a fixed list of parameters known to be accepted by
the Python side of the driver.  For example, to include a URL that indicates
the Python sqlite3 "timeout" and "check_same_thread" parameters, along with the
SQLite "mode" and "nolock" parameters, they can all be passed together on the
query string::

    e = create_engine(
        "sqlite:///file:path/to/database?"
        "check_same_thread=true&timeout=10&mode=ro&nolock=1&uri=true"
    )

Above, the pysqlite / sqlite3 DBAPI would be passed arguments as::

    sqlite3.connect(
        "file:path/to/database?mode=ro&nolock=1",
        check_same_thread=True,
        timeout=10,
        uri=True,
    )

Regarding future parameters added to either the Python or native drivers. new
parameter names added to the SQLite URI scheme should be automatically
accommodated by this scheme.  New parameter names added to the Python driver
side can be accommodated by specifying them in the
:paramref:`_sa.create_engine.connect_args` dictionary,
until dialect support is
added by SQLAlchemy.   For the less likely case that the native SQLite driver
adds a new parameter name that overlaps with one of the existing, known Python
driver parameters (such as "timeout" perhaps), SQLAlchemy\'s dialect would
require adjustment for the URL scheme to continue to support this.

As is always the case for all SQLAlchemy dialects, the entire "URL" process
can be bypassed in :func:`_sa.create_engine` through the use of the
:paramref:`_sa.create_engine.creator`
parameter which allows for a custom callable
that creates a Python sqlite3 driver level connection directly.

    the SQLite documentation

.. _pysqlite_regexp:

Regular Expression Support
---------------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.4

Support for the :meth:`_sql.ColumnOperators.regexp_match` operator is provided
using Python\'s re.search_ function.  SQLite itself does not include a working
regular expression operator; instead, it includes a non-implemented placeholder
operator ``REGEXP`` that calls a user-defined function that must be provided.

SQLAlchemy\'s implementation makes use of the pysqlite create_function_ hook
as follows::


    def regexp(a, b):
        return re.search(a, b) is not None


    sqlite_connection.create_function(
        "regexp",
        2,
        regexp,
    )

There is currently no support for regular expression flags as a separate
argument, as these are not supported by SQLite\'s REGEXP operator, however these
may be included inline within the regular expression string.  See `Python regular expressions`_ for
details.

Compatibility with sqlite3 "native" date and datetime types
-----------------------------------------------------------

The pysqlite driver includes the sqlite3.PARSE_DECLTYPES and
sqlite3.PARSE_COLNAMES options, which have the effect of any column
or expression explicitly cast as "date" or "timestamp" will be converted
to a Python date or datetime object.  The date and datetime types provided
with the pysqlite dialect are not currently compatible with these options,
since they render the ISO date/datetime including microseconds, which
pysqlite\'s driver does not.   Additionally, SQLAlchemy does not at
this time automatically render the "cast" syntax required for the
freestanding functions "current_timestamp" and "current_date" to return
datetime/date types natively.   Unfortunately, pysqlite
does not provide the standard DBAPI types in ``cursor.description``,
leaving SQLAlchemy with no way to detect these types on the fly
without expensive per-row type checks.

Keeping in mind that pysqlite\'s parsing option is not recommended,
nor should be necessary, for use with SQLAlchemy, usage of PARSE_DECLTYPES
can be forced if one configures "native_datetime=True" on create_engine()::

    engine = create_engine(
        "sqlite://",
        connect_args={
            "detect_types": sqlite3.PARSE_DECLTYPES | sqlite3.PARSE_COLNAMES
        },
        native_datetime=True,
    )

With this flag enabled, the DATE and TIMESTAMP types (but note - not the
DATETIME or TIME types...confused yet ?) will not perform any bind parameter
or result processing. Execution of "func.current_date()" will return a string.
"func.current_timestamp()" is registered as returning a DATETIME type in
SQLAlchemy, so this function still receives SQLAlchemy-level result
processing.

.. _pysqlite_threading_pooling:

Threading/Pooling Behavior
---------------------------

The ``sqlite3`` DBAPI by default prohibits the use of a particular connection
in a thread which is not the one in which it was created.  As SQLite has
matured, it\'s behavior under multiple threads has improved, and even includes
options for memory only databases to be used in multiple threads.

The thread prohibition is known as "check same thread" and may be controlled
using the ``sqlite3`` parameter ``check_same_thread``, which will disable or
enable this check. SQLAlchemy\'s default behavior here is to set
``check_same_thread`` to ``False`` automatically whenever a file-based database
is in use, to establish compatibility with the default pool class
:class:`.QueuePool`.

The SQLAlchemy ``pysqlite`` DBAPI establishes the connection pool differently
based on the kind of SQLite database that\'s requested:

* When a ``:memory:`` SQLite database is specified, the dialect by default
  will use :class:`.SingletonThreadPool`. This pool maintains a single
  connection per thread, so that all access to the engine within the current
  thread use the same ``:memory:`` database - other threads would access a
  different ``:memory:`` database.  The ``check_same_thread`` parameter
  defaults to ``True``.
* When a file-based database is specified, the dialect will use
  :class:`.QueuePool` as the source of connections.   at the same time,
  the ``check_same_thread`` flag is set to False by default unless overridden.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.0

    SQLite file database engines now use :class:`.QueuePool` by default.
    Previously, :class:`.NullPool` were used.  The :class:`.NullPool` class
    may be used by specifying it via the
    :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.poolclass` parameter.

Disabling Connection Pooling for File Databases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pooling may be disabled for a file based database by specifying the
:class:`.NullPool` implementation for the :func:`_sa.create_engine.poolclass`
parameter::

    from sqlalchemy import NullPool

    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///myfile.db", poolclass=NullPool)

It\'s been observed that the :class:`.NullPool` implementation incurs an
extremely small performance overhead for repeated checkouts due to the lack of
connection re-use implemented by :class:`.QueuePool`.  However, it still
may be beneficial to use this class if the application is experiencing
issues with files being locked.

Using a Memory Database in Multiple Threads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use a ``:memory:`` database in a multithreaded scenario, the same
connection object must be shared among threads, since the database exists
only within the scope of that connection.   The
:class:`.StaticPool` implementation will maintain a single connection
globally, and the ``check_same_thread`` flag can be passed to Pysqlite
as ``False``::

    from sqlalchemy.pool import StaticPool

    engine = create_engine(
        "sqlite://",
        connect_args={"check_same_thread": False},
        poolclass=StaticPool,
    )

Note that using a ``:memory:`` database in multiple threads requires a recent
version of SQLite.

Using Temporary Tables with SQLite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the way SQLite deals with temporary tables, if you wish to use a
temporary table in a file-based SQLite database across multiple checkouts
from the connection pool, such as when using an ORM :class:`.Session` where
the temporary table should continue to remain after :meth:`.Session.commit` or
:meth:`.Session.rollback` is called, a pool which maintains a single
connection must be used.   Use :class:`.SingletonThreadPool` if the scope is
only needed within the current thread, or :class:`.StaticPool` is scope is
needed within multiple threads for this case::

    # maintain the same connection per thread
    from sqlalchemy.pool import SingletonThreadPool

    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///mydb.db", poolclass=SingletonThreadPool)


    # maintain the same connection across all threads
    from sqlalchemy.pool import StaticPool

    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///mydb.db", poolclass=StaticPool)

Note that :class:`.SingletonThreadPool` should be configured for the number
of threads that are to be used; beyond that number, connections will be
closed out in a non deterministic way.


Dealing with Mixed String / Binary Columns
------------------------------------------------------

The SQLite database is weakly typed, and as such it is possible when using
binary values, which in Python are represented as ``b\'some string\'``, that a
particular SQLite database can have data values within different rows where
some of them will be returned as a ``b\'\'`` value by the Pysqlite driver, and
others will be returned as Python strings, e.g. ``\'\'`` values.   This situation
is not known to occur if the SQLAlchemy :class:`.LargeBinary` datatype is used
consistently, however if a particular SQLite database has data that was
inserted using the Pysqlite driver directly, or when using the SQLAlchemy
:class:`.String` type which was later changed to :class:`.LargeBinary`, the
table will not be consistently readable because SQLAlchemy\'s
:class:`.LargeBinary` datatype does not handle strings so it has no way of
"encoding" a value that is in string format.

To deal with a SQLite table that has mixed string / binary data in the
same column, use a custom type that will check each row individually::

    from sqlalchemy import String
    from sqlalchemy import TypeDecorator


    class MixedBinary(TypeDecorator):
        impl = String
        cache_ok = True

        def process_result_value(self, value, dialect):
            if isinstance(value, str):
                value = bytes(value, "utf-8")
            elif value is not None:
                value = bytes(value)

            return value

Then use the above ``MixedBinary`` datatype in the place where
:class:`.LargeBinary` would normally be used.

.. _pysqlite_serializable:

Serializable isolation / Savepoints / Transactional DDL
-------------------------------------------------------

A newly revised version of this important section is now available
at the top level of the SQLAlchemy SQLite documentation, in the section
:ref:`sqlite_transactions`.


.. _pysqlite_udfs:

User-Defined Functions
----------------------

pysqlite supports a `create_function() <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.create_function>`_
method that allows us to create our own user-defined functions (UDFs) in Python and use them directly in SQLite queries.
These functions are registered with a specific DBAPI Connection.

SQLAlchemy uses connection pooling with file-based SQLite databases, so we need to ensure that the UDF is attached to the
connection when it is created. That is accomplished with an event listener::

    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from sqlalchemy import event
    from sqlalchemy import text


    def udf():
        return "udf-ok"


    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///./db_file")


    @event.listens_for(engine, "connect")
    def connect(conn, rec):
        conn.create_function("udf", 0, udf)


    for i in range(5):
        with engine.connect() as conn:
            print(conn.scalar(text("SELECT UDF()")))
