    The original iterable will be advanced and its items will be cached until
    they are used by the child iterables. This may require significant storage.

    By default, attempting to select a bucket to which no items belong  will
    exhaust the iterable and cache all values.
    If you specify a *validator* function, selected buckets will instead be
    checked against it.
