class ProtocolError(Exception):
    """Exception indicating a violation of the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

    This as an abstract base class, with two concrete base classes:
    :exc:`LocalProtocolError`, which indicates that you tried to do something
    that HTTP/1.1 says is illegal, and :exc:`RemoteProtocolError`, which
    indicates that the remote peer tried to do something that HTTP/1.1 says is
    illegal. See :ref:`error-handling` for details.

    In addition to the normal :exc:`Exception` features, it has one attribute:

    .. attribute:: error_status_hint

       This gives a suggestion as to what status code a server might use if
       this error occurred as part of a request.

       For a :exc:`RemoteProtocolError`, this is useful as a suggestion for
       how you might want to respond to a misbehaving peer, if you're
       implementing a server.

       For a :exc:`LocalProtocolError`, this can be taken as a suggestion for
       how your peer might have responded to *you* if h11 had allowed you to
       continue.

       The default is 400 Bad Request, a generic catch-all for protocol
       violations.
